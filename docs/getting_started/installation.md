# Installation

There are two ways to install JSONMaestro:

1. Using pip
2. From source

## Using pip

To install JSONMaestro using pip, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install jsonmaestro
```

This will install the latest version of JSONMaestro from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## From source

If you prefer to install JSONMaestro from source, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbowne1/json-maestro.git # via https
git clone git@github.com:gbowne1/json-maestro.git # via ssh
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/cloned/json-maestro
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install JSONMaestro using your preferred method (NOTE: both are shown here, either one should work):

```bash
pip install . # for installing using pip
python setup.py install # for using setup.py script
```
